# SpaceShip

C#.Net project with Ryan DeCoster (https://github.com/ryandecoster).

Ryan designed the SpaceShip game, I designed the website to go along with it.  We did not link a database to track user scores.  There is a section for making a post, liking a post, commenting on a post, and liking a comment.
